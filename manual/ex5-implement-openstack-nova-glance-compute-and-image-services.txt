To Implement OpenStack Nova - Compute and Image services -Glance

PROCEDURAL STEPS:


Prepare the Environment:
Step 1: Set up a physical or virtual machine to serve as the compute node.
Install a supported operating system (typically a Linux distribution).
Ensure the machine meets the minimum requirements for running OpenStack Nova- Compute.
Step 2: Install and Configure the Compute Node:
Step 3: Update the system packages and repositories.
Step 4: Install the necessary dependencies, such as Python and other required packages.
Step 5: Install and configure the hypervisor software you plan to use (e.g., KVM, VMware).
Step 6: Install the Nova-Compute service and its dependencies using the package manager (e.g., apt, yum).
Step 7: Configure the Nova-Compute service by editing the configuration file (/etc/nova/nova.conf). Set appropriate values for options like authentication, messaging. networking, and hypervisor-related settings.
Step 8: Optionally, configure additional features like live migration, GPU passthrough, etc., as per your requirements.

Configure Networking:
Step 1: Ensure the compute node has network connectivity to the OpenStack controller node and other services.
Step 2: Configure the network settings in the Nova-Compute configuration file (/etc/nova/nova.conf). Specify the appropriate network provider, the URL of the message queue service, authentication credentials, etc.
Step 3: Enable and Start Nova-Oompute Service:
Step 4: Enable the Nova-Compute service to start automatically at boot time.
Step 5: Start the Nova-Compute service using the appropriate service manager for your operating system (c.g., systemetl, service)

Verify Compute Node Registration:
Step 1: On the OpenStack controller node, use the OpenStack command-line client or API to verify if the compute node is registered and recognized by the OpenStack environment.
Step 2: Validate the connectivity between the controller node and the compute node.
Step 3: Confirm that the hypervisor and other services on the compute node are running without errors.

Test Instance Launch:
Step 1: Use the OpenStack dashboard (Horizon) or command-line client to launch a test instance on the compute node.
Step 2: Monitor the instance creation process, ensuring that it is scheduled to run on the compute node.
Step 3: Verify that the instance becomes active and is accessible over the network.

By following these steps, you should be able to implement and configure OpenStack Nova-Compute successfully. Remember that this is a simplified overview, and you may need to consult the OpenStack documentation for more detailed information and troubleshooting guidance specific to your deployment scenario

To implement OpenStack Glance (Image Service), you need to follow these step-by-step procedures:

Set up the environment:

Install and configure the database:
Step 1: Install and configure the database server (eg, MySQL, MariaDB).
Step 2: Create a database and database user for Nova and Glance services

Install and configure message queue service:
Step 1: Install RabbitMQ, which is the recommended message queue service for OpenStack
Step 2: Configure RabbitMQ to enable communication between OpenStack services.

Install and configure Identity service (Keystone):
Step 1: Install Keystone and configure the database and RabbitMQ options in the Keystone configuration file.
Step 2: Configure the admin token and endpoint URLs.

Install and configure Compute service (Nova):
Step 1: Install Nova Compute and its dependencies.
Step 2: Configure the database and RabbitMQ options in the Nova configuration file.
Step 3: Configure authentication and authorization settings in the Nova configuration file.
Step 4: Configure the placement service (used for resource tracking) in the Nova configuration file.
Step 5: Start and enable the Nova Compute service.

Install and configure Image service (Glance):
Step 1: Install Glance and its dependencies.
Step 2: Configure the database and RabbitMQ options in the Glance configuration file.
Step 3: Configure the image storage backend (e.g., local file system, Swift, Ceph) in the Glance configuration file.
Step 4: Start and enable the Glance API and Glance Registry services.
Step 5: Verify the installation:
Step 6: Use the OpenStack command-line client (e.g., openstack) or API to verify that Nova and Glance services are running correctly.
Step 7: Test creating and managing instances using the Nova Compute service.
Step 8: Test uploading and retrieving images using the Glance Image service.
